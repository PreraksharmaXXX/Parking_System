Overview

The Smart and Effective Street Parking project is an AI-based parking management system that helps in detecting vacant and occupied parking spots using computer vision and machine learning. This system processes real-time video footage from CCTV or drone cameras to provide insights into parking space availability, optimizing urban parking efficiency.

Features

Real-time Detection: Identifies vacant and occupied parking spaces from live video feeds.

Computer Vision-based Processing: Uses OpenCV and deep learning models for accurate detection.

Scalability: Can be deployed for small parking lots or large urban areas.

Integration with Mobile/Web Apps: Can be extended to provide parking availability information to users.

Data Logging & Analytics: Stores parking occupancy data for analytics and optimization.# Parking_System
